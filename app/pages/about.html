             Andy, the highway looked so dark When the black took control of my eyes When something made my focus smash And I'll be back when the rest of it dies The voice in my head was gone Every sort of person looked like hell With their hands in their pockets And the marks on their scalp If I get a chance to breathe I couldn't breathe under all of that weight, and the things that we've seen. With all the dead, with their hats on their chest, and their thoughts in the leaves. I can't breathe (The highway looked so dark I'm drowning underwater) Tear the fever out of my lungs, put the cold back under my tongue.Andy, the highway looked so dark When the black took control of my eyes When something made my focus smash And I'll be back when the rest of it dies The voice in my head was gone Every sort of person looked like hell With their hands in their pockets And the marks on their scalp If I get a chance to breathe I couldn't breathe under all of that weight, and the things that we've seen.
